## 🧠 Learnings

Through building WikiFinder, I explored and strengthened the following:

- 📚 **React fundamentals**: Components, props, state, and hooks  
- ⚡ **API integration**: Calling and rendering data from the Wikipedia REST API  
- 🎨 **UI design with Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling and responsive layout  
- 🧩 **Conditional rendering**: Managing dynamic UI based on user interaction   
- 🎆 **tsparticles**: Integrating interactive background effects  
- 🧠 **Debugging skills**: Handling edge cases, layout issues, and state bugs  
- 🚀 **Deploying**: Hosting the app live using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

This project helped me go from learning individual concepts to applying them in a real-world app.
